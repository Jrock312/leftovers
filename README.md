# leftovers
## Description:
If you are to lazy to eat out and constantly order in, what happens to all the "left-over" ingredients around the house? How much money is spent on delivery fees?  With leftovers we want to allow users the ability to enter these ingreients in a search field and find out what options they have. But what good is just an ingredients list?  We want to take it a step further and show you how to make the recipe as well.

Simply follow the prompts on the app and enter the ingredients that you have on hand and "leftovers" will take care of the rest.  In addition to just food "leftovers" lets you take drinks around the house and gives you ideas on how to make a tasty alchaholic beverage to go with the meal you just made.
